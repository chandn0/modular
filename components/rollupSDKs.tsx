<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Rollup SDKs and Frameworks</h1>

<p className="mb-4">Rollup SDKs serve as frameworks that empower developers to construct customized rollups from the ground up. In practical terms, this allows any developer to create their dedicated application-specific rollup (AppRollup) using the same underlying software as popular general-purpose rollups such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Notable rollup SDK providers include Arbitrum Orbit, the OP Stack, and Rollkit.</p>
